<h1><i><mark>MY EXPERIENCE DURING COVID-19</mark></i></H1>

<h2><p>When the Malaysian prime minister announced the MCO, I was at UiTM campus on 17 March 2020. I was directed back home to prevent Covid-19 from infecting me. Since MCO, I have to learn from home until now. For me it is quite difficult to study online especially for the subjects that require tutorial like IMS456 subject. Although this subject is difficult, I still try to find a way to make it easier by learning it through the Youtube application. The MCO has also taught me to be self-discipline by complying with all movement control orders. I have also tried a variety of cuisines during MCO including Dalgona coffee. Finally, I really hope Covid-19 will be disappear from this world because all my plans are cancelled, especially my wedding and I have to postpone for next year.</p>

<h1><i><mark>MY EXPERIENCE IN "NEW ZEALAND"</mark></i></H1>

    <h2><p>NOPES, ITS NOT NEW ZEALAND IN EUROPE BUT IN KELANTAN!!! I went there to satisfy my bestfriend's wish. The scenery there is relaxed maybe because i went there in weekday because no crowded happened. The white fences and the hill background make the view looks more beautiful. Many people captured some pictures at the white fences to be stored as memory including me!</p>

            <h1><i><mark>MY EXPERIENCE IN THE JUNGLE</mark></i></H1>

                <h2><p>of the many activities I have ever participated in, I think getting involved in camping activities is the most challenging because I dont really like an adventure activities like my dad does. Because I think that I cannot survive. Plus, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hate t be in sweat except during my workout but for outdoor activities I think NOPE. But here is my experience, I joined the "Biodiversity Education Program" in form 6. I think it a good and tough experience for me. There, I have learned how to survive in the middle of the jungle. Various activities that my friends and I did during the program. Among them are jungle trekking, hiking, listening to talks about wild animals in the forest and more. For me this is a worthwhile experience. But if i WAS given the opportunity to join this program again, I will probably refuse, just once is enough for me to join this kind of program &#128514;.</p>
